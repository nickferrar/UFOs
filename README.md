## Chapter 11 JavaScript

## Overview:

The purpose of this project is to add additional filters to the work in the module. The module provided a framework to have a table on a webpage to filter data through the date
and in this assignment I added filters for the city, state, country and shape. 

## Results:

You can filter results by typing into any of the search boxes and pressing enter. There is a premarked value that can be ignoored. When you erase a value you press enter again to 
reset the table. 

The filter can work for cities such as the following:

Or you can put a state like the following:

Combinations of values will also work like the following picture shows:

## Summary:

One drawback of this new design is that you have to type the data in exactly for it to filter. So in essence you have to look through the data to find what you want and then type
it in.

Two recommendations I would make are drop boxes with all of the choices included and a "select all" button to press or cancel. Another recommendation would be to filter the data 
as you type it in. For example if you start by typing "b" for city then it filters all of the cities that start with a "b" instead of waiting for the entire city to be typed out
and then confirmed with an "enter" press.
